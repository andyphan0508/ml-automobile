# MACHINE LEARNING - AUTOMOBILE
Learning the dataset, might contains all the information of types of car we wants to learn from it

These repository included:
  
  - A dataset file: import-85.data
  - A dataset information file: import-85.names
  - A Python runtime file: Automobile.py

Why machine learning this kind of dataset?
  
  This data set wants user (or coders) to predics the price tag of the car with all the number are Numerics and Booleans
  
  Method: an instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm derived from a
	    localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm.  Compared with a
	    linear regression prediction...so all instances
	    with missing attribute values were discarded.  This resulted with
	    a training set of 159 instances, which was also used as a test
	    set (minus the actual instance during testing).
